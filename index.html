          The big bang model is the most widely accepted theory regarding the
          formation of the universe. It was first proposed in the 1920s by
          Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître and Russian mathematician
          Aleksandr Friedmann. In the 1940s George Gamow and his colleagues
          developed the modern version of this theory which we still use today.
          The theory assumes that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity
          and the cosmological principle are true. This theory applies only to
          the large-scale aspects of the universe because Einstein’s Theory of
          Relativity does not apply in the quantum space. The big bang model
          states that the universe doesn’t have an edge which means that the big
          bang didn’t happen at one point in space but throughout space at the
          same time. The universe was very dense at the beginning and had a lot
          of heat energy. The big bang wasn't an explosion it was the rapid
          expansion of the universe and soon after the beginning of the
          expansion matter asserted dominance over antimatter. In this stage,
          there may have been many elementary particles present. A few seconds
          after that the universe had cooled down enough to allow the formation
          of some nuclei and certain amounts of hydrogen, helium, and lithium
          were produced. And finally, about 1 million years later the universe
          had cooled down enough so that atoms could form.
